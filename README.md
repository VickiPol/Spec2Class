# Spec2ChemClass
Prediction of chemical classes using LC-MS spectra with Vicky, Nir and Dudi

To do:

1) Upload Vicky's scripts and models
2) Get class info from plant/bacterial relevant structural libraries (Nir)
3) Collect spike-in raw data to use as mid-step for model implementation (Nir)
4) Retrain particual classes/sub-classes with >3 epochs. Evaluation results (Vicky)
